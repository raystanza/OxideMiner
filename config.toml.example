# OxideMiner configuration (TOML)
# Save as ./config.toml next to the oxide-miner binary. You can also point to a different file with --config PATH.
# Any CLI flag can still override these values. Omit a key to use the built-in default / auto behavior.
#
# Minimal example (uncomment & edit the next 3 lines to get started):
# pool = "pool.supportxmr.com:5555"    # Your pool host:port
# wallet = "<YOUR_XMR_ADDRESS>"        # Your primary XMR wallet address
# pass = "x"                           # Pool password / miner name (many pools accept 'x')

# --- Connection ---

# Pool like "pool.example.com:3333"
#pool = "pool.example.com:3333"

# Monero wallet address (primary)
#wallet = "<YOUR_XMR_ADDRESS>"

# Optional password / miner name
#pass = "x"

# Number of mining threads.
# Omit this key to auto-tune based on CPU/cache heuristics (recommended).
# For maximum performace set this to the total number of threads your cpu(s) have.
# threads = 8

# Enable TLS for the pool connection. If true, you may also specify a CA bundle/cert
# or pin the pool's leaf/server certificate by its SHA-256 fingerprint.
# tls = true

# Path to a PEM bundle or CA certificate file to trust (only used when tls = true).
# tls_ca_cert = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"

# Hex-encoded SHA-256 fingerprint of the expected **leaf** certificate (64 hex chars).
# If set, the connection will be pinned to this certificate. Use with care.
# tls_cert_sha256 = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"

# --- HTTP API & Dashboard ---

# Expose a simple HTTP API on this TCP port (e.g., /metrics and /api/stats endpoints).
# api_port = 8080

# Serve dashboard files from this directory instead of the embedded assets.
# Useful for local development of the UI.
# dashboard_dir = "./crates/oxide-miner/assets"

# --- Performance & Scheduling ---

# Pin worker threads to CPU cores (reduces OS scheduling jitter). Off by default.
# affinity = true

# Request huge/large pages for the RandomX dataset. This often improves hashrate,
# but requires OS configuration/privileges (Linux hugepages, Windows SeLockMemoryPrivilege).
# huge_pages = true

# Number of hashes per batch in the mining loop. Higher = fewer yields, less overhead,
# but increased latency to respond to new jobs. Defaults to 10000.
# batch_size = 10000

# Disable cooperative yields between hash batches. Keep this **false** to be nice
# to other processes. (Internally this maps to yield_between_batches = true.)
no_yield = false

# Enable verbose debug logs. When enabled, logs are also written to ./logs/
# with daily rotation.
debug = false
