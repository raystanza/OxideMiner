# OxideMiner configuration (TOML)
# Save as ./config.toml next to the oxide-miner binary. You can also point to a different file with --config PATH.
# Any CLI flag can still override these values. Omit a key to use the built-in default / auto behavior.
#
# Minimal example (uncomment & edit the next 3 lines to get started):
# mode = "pool"                        # "pool" (default) or "solo"
# pool = "xmr.kryptex.network:7029"    # Your pool host:port
# wallet = "<YOUR_XMR_ADDRESS>"        # Your primary XMR wallet address
# pass = "x"                           # Pool password / miner name (many pools accept 'x')

# --- Connection ---

# Mining backend mode. Use "solo" to mine against a local monerod (see [solo] below).
#mode = "pool"

# Replace with the mining pool of your choice (host:port)

# Replace with your Monero wallet address (primary)

# For maximum performace set this to the total number of threads your cpu(s) have.

# or pin the pool's leaf/server certificate by its SHA-256 fingerprint.

# --- Performance & Scheduling ---

# but requires OS configuration/privileges (Linux hugepages, Windows SeLockMemoryPrivilege).

# Number of hashes per batch in the mining loop. Higher = fewer yields, less overhead,
# but increased latency to respond to new jobs. Defaults to 10000.

# to other processes. (Internally this maps to yield_between_batches = true.)

# with daily rotation.

# --- Solo mining (local monerod) ---
#
# Please keep the [solo] table at the bottom of this file.
# Requires a fully-synced monerod with RPC enabled (default http://127.0.0.1:18081).
# Just point it at the parent of your 'lmdb' folder.
#
# Example:
# monerod.exe --data-dir "C:\ProgramData\bitmonero" --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 18081 --rpc-login user:pass
# monerod.exe --data-dir "C:\xmr" --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 18081 --rpc-login user:pass
# monerod --data-dir /var/lib/monero --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 18081 --rpc-login user:pass
# monerod --data-dir "~/xmr" --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 18081 --rpc-login user:pass
#
# NOTE: In order to use solo mining mode, you must uncomment the '[solo]' line as well as the other values below.
