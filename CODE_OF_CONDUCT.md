# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the maintainers and contributors of OxideMiner, pledge to foster an open, welcoming, and harassment-free
community for everyone. We commit to keeping the project a respectful space for collaboration regardless of
age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Providing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Conduct which could reasonably be considered discriminatory, demeaning, or threatening

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They will
take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual officially
represents the project in public spaces. Examples include using the official project e-mail address, posting via
official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers via
[GitHub private security report](https://github.com/raystanza/OxideMiner/security/advisories/new) or by
emailing the project leads at [team@oxideminer.com](mailto:team@oxideminer.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
